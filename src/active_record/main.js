/**
 * @namespace {ActiveRecord}
 * @example
 * 
 * ActiveRecord
 * ============
 * 
 * ActiveRecord.js is a cross browser, cross platform, stand-alone object
 * relational mapper. It shares a very similar vocabulary to the Ruby
 * ActiveRecord implementation, but uses JavaScript idioms and best
 * practices -- it is not a direct port. It can operate using an in memory
 * hash table, or with a SQL back end on the Jaxer platform (SQLite and
 * MySQL), Adobe's AIR (SQLite) and Google Gears (SQLite). Support
 * for the HTML 5 SQL storage spec is planned.
 * 
 * Setup
 * -----
 * To begin using ActiveRecord.js, you will need to include the
 * activerecord.js file and establish a connection. If you do not specify
 * a connection type, one will be automatically chosen.
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.connect();
 * 
 * You can also specify a specific type of adapter. Jaxer requires
 * pre-configuring of the database for the entire application, and Gears
 * automatically configures the database, so simply passing the type of
 * connection is enough. In all of the SQLite implementations you can
 * optionally specify a database name (browser) or path (Jaxer):
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.connect(ActiveRecord.Adapters.InMemory); //in JS memory
 *     ActiveRecord.connect(ActiveRecord.Adapters.JaxerMySQL); //Jaxer MySQL
 *     ActiveRecord.connect(ActiveRecord.Adapters.JaxerSQLite); //Jaxer SQLite
 *     ActiveRecord.connect(ActiveRecord.Adapters.AIR); //Adobe AIR
 *     ActiveRecord.connect(ActiveRecord.Adapters.Gears,'my_database'); //Gears or HTML5, name is optional
 *     
 * Once connected you can always execute SQL statements directly:
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, user_id, title, text)');
 *     
 * Logging (to either the Jaxer log or browser console) can be turned on by setting:
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.logging = true;
 * 
 * InMemory Adapter
 * ----------------
 * If you are using a browser or platform that does not have access to a SQL
 * database, you can use the InMemory adapter which will store your objects
 * in memory. All features (including find by SQL) will still work, but you
 * will not be able to use the Migration features, since there is no table
 * schema. Since your objects will not persist, the second parameter to
 * establish a connection is a hash with the data you would like to use
 * in this format: {table_name: {id: row}}. The InMemory adapter will also
 * trigger three observable events that allow you to write an AJAX
 * persistence layer.
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.connect(ActiveRecord.Adapters.InMemory,{
 *         table_one: {
 *             1: {row_data},
 *             2: {row_data}
 *         },
 *         table_two: {
 *             1: {row_data},
 *             2: {row_data}
 *         }
 *     });
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.connection.observe('created',function(table_name,id,data){});
 *     ActiveRecord.connection.observe('updated',function(table_name,id,data){});
 *     ActiveRecord.connection.observe('destroyed',function(table_name,id){});
 *     
 * Defining Your Model
 * -------------------
 * ActiveRecord classes are created using the ActiveRecord.create method which
 * takes three arguments: the name of the table that the class will reference,
 * a field definition hash, and optionally a hash of instance methods that
 * will be added to the class. If the table does not exist it will be
 * automically created.
 *
 *     var User = ActiveRecord.create('users',{
 *         username: '',
 *         password: '',
 *         post_count: 0,
 *         profile: {
 *             type: 'TEXT',
 *             value: ''
 *         }
 *     },{
 *         getProfileWordCount: function(){
 *             return this.get('profile').split(/\s+/).length;
 *         }
 *     });
 * 
 * Class & Instance Methods
 * ------------------------
 * JavaScript does not have true static methods or classes, but in this case any
 * method of the User variable above is refered to as a class method, and any
 * method of a particular user (that the User class would find) is refered to as
 * an instance method. The most important class methods are create() and find():
 * 
 *     var jessica = User.create({
 *         username: 'Jessica',
 *         password: 'rabbit'
 *     });
 * 
 * Add new class or instance methods to all ActiveRecord models in the following
 * way:
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.ClassMethods.myClassMethod = function(){
 *         //this === model class
 *     };
 *     ActiveRecord.InstanceMethods.myInstanceMethod = function(){
 *         // this === model instance
 *     };
 * 
 * Getters & Setters
 * -----------------
 * It is extremely important to note that all of the attributes/columns of the user
 * are accessible directly for reading (for convenience), but cannot be written
 * directly. You **must** use the set() method to set an attribute, you **should**
 * use the get() method to access all attributes, but you **must** use the get()
 * method if your attribute/column is a method of the object or a JavaScript
 * reserved keyword ('save,'initialize','default', etc).
 * 
 *     jessica.username // 'Jessica'
 *     jessica.get('username'); // 'Jessica'
 *     jessica.username = 'new username';
 *     jessica.get('username'); // 'Jessica'
 *     jessica.set('username','new username');
 *     jessica.get('username'); // 'new username'
 * 
 * When Data is Persisted
 * ----------------------
 * Data is only persisted to the database in three cases: when you explicitly call
 * save() on a record, when you call create() on a record, or create a child record
 * through a relationship (the method will contain the word "create" in this case),
 * or when you call updateAttribute() on a record. In the case of the latter, only
 * the attribute you update will be saved, the rest of the record will not be
 * persisted to the database, even if changes have been made. Calling save() may
 * add an "id" property to the record if it does not exist, but if there are no
 * errors, it's state will otherwise be unchanged. You can call refresh() on any
 * record to ensure it is not out of synch with your database at any time.
 * 
 * Finding Records
 * ---------------
 * If you created the User class using the define() method you automatically have
 * free "finder" methods:
 * 
 *     User.findByUsername('Jessica');
 *     User.findAllByPassword(''); //finds all with blank passwords
 * 
 * Otherwise you can use the base find() method, which takes a hash of options,
 * a numeric id or a complete SQL string:
 * 
 *     var posts = Post.find({
 *         all: true,
 *         order: 'id DESC',
 *         limit: 10
 *     });
 * 
 * Synchronization
 * ---------------
 * It is sometimes useful to keep records that have already been found in synch
 * with the database. Each found record has a synchronize() method that will keep
 * the values of that record in synch with the database. If you pass the parameter
 * synchronize: true to find(), all objects will have their values synchronized,
 * and in addition the result set itself will update as objects are destroyed or
 * created. Both features are relatively expensive operations, and are not
 * automatically garbage collected/stopped when the record or result set goes
 * out of scope, so you will need to explicitly stop both record and result set
 * synchronization.
 * 
 *     var aaron = User.findByName('aaron');
 *     aaron.synchronize();
 * 
 *     var aaron_clone = User.findByName('aaron');
 *     aaron_clone.set('name','Aaron!');
 *     aaron_clone.save();
 * 
 *     aaron.get('name') === 'Aaron!';
 *     aaron.stop(); //record will no longer be synchronized
 * 
 *     var users = User.find({
 *         all: true,
 *         synchronize: true
 *     });
 *     //users contains aaron
 *     aaron.destroy();
 *     //users will no longer contain aaron
 *     users.stop(); //result set will no longer be synchronized
 * 
 * Calculations (count, min, max, etc) can also be synchronized. As a second
 * parameter to the calculation function, pass a hash with a synchronize
 * property that contains a function. That function will be called when the
 * result of the calculation changes. Instead of returning the value of the
 * calculation the initial call to the calculation function will return a
 * function that will stop the synchronization.
 *
 *     var current_count;
 *     var stop = User.count({
 *         synchronize: function(updated_count){
 *             current_count = updated_count;
 *         }
 *     });
 *     var new_user = User.create({params}); //current_count incremented
 *     new_user.destroy();  //current_count decremented
 *     stop();
 *     User.create({params}); //current_count unchanged
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 * There are 8 currently supported lifecycle events which allow granular control
 * over your data, and are convenient to build user interface components and
 * interactions around on the client side:
 * 
 * - afterFind
 * - afterInitialize
 * - beforeSave
 * - afterSave
 * - beforeCreate
 * - afterCreate
 * - beforeDestroy
 * - afterDestroy
 * 
 * beforeSave and afterSave are called when both creating (inserting) and saving
 * (updating) a record. You can observe events on all instances of a class, or
 * just a particular instnace:
 * 
 *     User.observe('afterCreate',function(user){
 *         console.log('User with id of ' + user.id + ' was created.');
 *     });
 * 
 *     var u = User.find(5);
 *     u.observe('afterDestroy',function(){
 *         //this particular user was destroyed
 *     });
 * 
 * In the example above, each user that is created will be passed to the first
 * callback. You can also call stopObserving() to remove a given observer, and
 * use the observeOnce() method (same arguments as observe()) method if needed.
 * Alternately, each event name is also a convience method and the following
 * example is functionally equivelent to the prior example:
 * 
 *     User.afterCreate(function(user){
 *         console.log('User with id of ' + user.id + ' was created.');
 *     });
 * 
 *     var u = User.find(5);
 *     u.afterDestroy(function(){
 *         //this particular user was destroyed
 *     });
 * 
 * You can stop the creation, saving or destruction of a record by returning
 * false inside any observers of the beforeCreate, beforeSave and
 * beforeDestroy events respectively:
 * 
 *     User.beforeDestroy(function(user){
 *         if(!allow_deletion_checkbox.checked){
 *             return false; //record will not be destroyed
 *         }
 *     });
 *
 * Returning null, or returning nothing is equivelent to returning true in
 * this context and will not stop the event.
 *     
 * To observe a given event on all models, you can do the following: 
 * 
 *     ActiveRecord.observe('created',function(model_class,model_instance){});
 *     
 * afterFind works differently than all of the other events. It is only available
 * to the model class, not the instances, and is called only when a result set is
 * found. A find first, or find by id call will not trigger the event.
 * 
 *     User.observe('afterFind',function(users,params){
 *         //params contains the params used to find the array of users
 *     });
 *     
 * Validation
 * ----------
 * Validation is performed on each model instance when create() or save() is
 * called. Validation can be applied either by using pre defined validations
 * (validatesPresenceOf, validatesLengthOf, more will be implemented soon), or by
 * defining a valid() method in the class definition. (or by both). If a record is
 * not valid, save() will return false. create() will always return the record,
 * but in either case you can call getErrors() on the record to determine if
 * there are any errors present.
 * 
 *     User = ActiveRecord.define('users',{
 *         username: '',
 *         password: ''
 *     },{
 *         valid: function(){
 *             if(User.findByUsername(this.username)){
 *                 this.addError('The username ' + this.username + ' is already taken.');
 *             }
 *         }
 *     });
 * 
 *     User.validatesPresenceOf('password');
 * 
 *     var user = User.build({
 *         'username': 'Jessica'
 *     });
 * 
 *     user.save(); //false
 *     var errors = user.getErrors(); //contains a list of the errors that occured
 *     user.set('password','rabbit');
 *     user.save(); //true
 *     
 * Relationships
 * -------------
 * Relationships are declared with one of three class methods that are available
 *  to all models:
 * 
 * - belongsTo
 * - hasMany
 * - hasOne
 * 
 * The related model name can be specified in a number of ways, assuming that you
 * have a Comment model already declared, any of the following would work:
 * 
 *     User.hasMany(Comment)
 *     User.hasMany('Comment')
 *     User.hasMany('comment')
 *     User.hasMany('comments')
 * 
 * Each relationship adds various instance methods to each instance of that
 * model. This differs significantly from the Rails "magical array" style of
 * handling relationship logic:
 * 
 * Rails:
 * 
 *     u = User.find(5)
 *     u.comments.length
 *     u.comments.create :title => 'comment title'
 * 
 * ActiveRecord.js:
 * 
 *     var u = User.find(5);
 *     u.getCommentList().length;
 *     u.createComment({title: 'comment title'});
 * 
 * You can name the relationship (and thus the generate methods) by passing
 * a name parameter:
 * 
 *     TreeNode.belongsTo(TreeNode,{name: 'parent'});
 *     TreeNode.hasMany(TreeNode,{name: 'child'});
 *     //instance now have, getParent(), getChildList(), methods
 * 
 * Missing Features
 * ----------------
 * ActiveRecord.js will not support all of the advanced features of the Ruby
 * ActiveRecord implementation, but several key features are currently missing
 * and will be added soon:
 * 
 * - complete set of default validations from ActiveRecord::Validations::ClassMethods
 * - ActsAsList
 * - ActsAsTree
 * - hasMany :through (which will likely be the only supported many to many relationship)
